ROADGARUD 🚦

YOLO-Based Road Object Detection Model

📌 Project Overview

ROADGARUD is a computer vision project focused on detecting road-related objects using a YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model. The model was trained as part of a Kaggle competition, leveraging annotated datasets to achieve accurate and real-time object detection for road safety and traffic analysis use cases.

The project demonstrates end-to-end model training, evaluation, and submission following Kaggle competition standards.

🎯 Objective

Train a YOLO-based object detection model on a road-scene dataset

Accurately detect and classify road-related objects (e.g., vehicles, signs, obstacles, etc.)

Prepare and submit predictions in Kaggle-compatible format

🧠 Model & Approach

Implemented YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection

Trained on a Kaggle-provided dataset using supervised learning

Optimized model performance through multiple training iterations

Generated predictions and packaged them into a Kaggle-ready submission
